Branching

- Origin is the default branch created when we run git init

- HEAD is the pointer that points to the current branch

- To create new branch
  git branch branchName
  
- Switch Branch
  git checkout BranchName 
  
- Merge
  git checkout master (the branch you want to merge to)
  git merge branchName (the branch you want to merge from)
  
- Delete a branch
  git branch -d branchName
